He can subscribe to the newsletter so that he will receive all the news by email. And finally, the possibility of contacting the administration.
the administrator, who must first authenticate, to have access to mission management, publication management, opportunity management, event management, team management, chatbot knowledge management, the consultation and modification of contact points, communication with beneficiaries, consultation of the list of subscribers and the sending of news by e-mail, consultation of personal information or modification of password.
and finally he has access to consult, add, modify or delete users who are: either manager, in fact the latter has access to all the functions of the administrator except user management, or the editor which has functionalities limited by the administrator, since they are specified by the latter.
